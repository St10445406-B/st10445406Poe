# Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS)
## Overview

The Contract Monthly Claim System (CMCS) is a prototype web application built using ASP.NET MVC.
It is designed to simplify the process of managing lecturer claims within an academic institution.
The system provides:
A Dashboard with quick access to Lecturers, Claims, and Status Tracking.
A Lecturer Management Page for viewing and navigating to lecturer-related tasks.
A Claims Page where claims can be submitted, verified, and approved.
A Claim Form that allows lecturers to upload supporting documents and track submission status.
Although this prototype does not contain backend logic, it demonstrates the UI design, navigation flow, and front-end layout of the system.
